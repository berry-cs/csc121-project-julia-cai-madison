PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 49 Why she couldn't just use her own two fingers to do the job herself, you have no idea.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 50 reluctantly flies over to scroll down on her laptop to a few bird objects.

PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 52 "Alright"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 53 Swift: "A harder one you say..."

PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 122 “To tell you if it’s wrong or not.”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 123 Vince: “Don’t even worry, dude. Just answer what you think it is. I’ll be right here”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 124 You give him not-so-subtle puppy dog eyes and he responds with a comforting hand on your shoulder.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 125 …You should get Vince’s input, just to be safe.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 126 …
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 127 Ok ok, Types. You know what types are, right? Yeah you do. 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 128 “Knowing that, what type do you think goes in the first var line?”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 129 “They have a name, a size and a true or false for if they’re a predator or not.”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 130 “Remember my parameters for a bird?”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 131 Swift: “Anyway.”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 132 She rolls her eyes.(or just use her mad sprite)
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 133 User: “I don’t care how similar it looks, I’m never letting go.”
PASSIVE images/Bed_code.png 6 134 He makes sure to pop the “P” as loudly as possible
PASSIVE images/Bed_code.png 6 135 Vince: “Nope.”
PASSIVE images/Bed_code.png 6 136 Swift:” Looks just like your precious Java doesn’t it. It's even got the little classes and everything.”
PASSIVE images/Bed_code.png 6 137 Swift: “Don’t be silly- Now, look at this…”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 138 Swift’s eyes find something interesting on the ceiling away from you and Vince’s annoyed gazes.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 139 Vince:”Wait, wait, wait. You’re just trying to get us on your language.”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 140 Vince squints in confusion, thinks for a moment, and then gives her an equally suspicious look. 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 141 User: “Yeah, I don’t believe you. There’s no way you couldn’t just do this yourself in 3 seconds.”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 142 hm.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 143 Too simple.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 144 Sounds simple enough.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 145 You nod, and Vince mock salutes.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 146 “I need you two to tell me which types go where based on the parameters I told you about.”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 147 “My class is a mess, so the two of you are going to help me fix it.” 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 148 “I already know Vince. Hold your horses.”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 149 She points a testy finger at him before he can do so.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 150 You know he’s gearing up to tell her everything wrong with the thing.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 151 Vince squints at the screen with an amusing intensity you know he only reserves for his code critique preparation.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 152 You follow her pointing finger to an unfinished class called “birds”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 153 Swift: "Here."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 154 She must sense your despair because she flashes you a devious smile and scrolls to the top of one of her files.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 155 You want to sob.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 156 It couldn't be any smaller than a deeply complex program made by a team professionals. 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 157 Then, Swift opens her laptop to her personal coding software and clicks on a project folder.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 158 She snaps her fingers and Darwin quickly lands to set her phone on the table. 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 159 Swift: “Wonderful.”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 160 You nod. Sounds simple enough.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 161 “That make sense?”
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 162 "Each of them have a given name, and size. As well as a true or false for if they're a predator or not."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 163 "I’m making a class for birds."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 164 She clicks her tongue and Darwin uses a manicured claw to swipe to the next slide showing a picture of a class diagram.  
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 165 "My project is simple enough."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 166 An, impressive trick, you will admit. But that's all the praise that flying rat is getting from you.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 167 Then, she blows a short whistle to Darwin and the bird straightens to attention, swooping up to grab her phone and suspend it in midair for our viewing pleasure.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 168 She pulls out her similarly hot pink phone and pulls up a picture of what looks to be a slideshow of some kind. 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 169 "Now then"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 170 Swift: "Upgrades~"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 171 Vince: "Could've sworn it was rose gold the week before..."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 172 Swift: "I figured it was time for an upgrade from pastel blue. So last week if you ask me."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 173 What happened to last week's laptop."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 174 Vince: "That looks new...
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 175 It's practically factory new and you have a feeling that's not too far off the mark.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 176 She somehow pulls out a slim, violently pink laptop from the deepest reaches of her long leather coat and sits it on your small kitchen table.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 177 "Now about my project."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 178 Wha-
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 179 Swift: So long as you're washing that thing, Vincent.

PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 185 Vince: "But this was a gift from a very dear friend of mine. I could never disrespect their generosity like that"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 186 The poor thing's gathering dust in that closet and it's spelled CORRECTLY"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 187 User: "I still don't understand why you don't just wear your real one.

PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 189 *He looks down at it and giggles to himself and fakes flicking away a tear*
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 190 "Just happen to really like this one."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 191 Vince: "Oh come off it you know I have clothes."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 192 "I mean this with love, but do you need a trip to Banana Republic?"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 193 Swift: "Vince dear, I swear to god I saw you wear that exact tee-shirt Monday, Wednesday and Yesterday."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 194 You had no idea just how serious he was.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 195 He pulled that tee right over his robe and vowed rather loudly to both of your attending families that he would wear this shirt "Every single day."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 196 His family got a chuckle out of it but Vince, you might as well have given him a new puppy.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 197 You still remember the look on his face when he opened that misleadingly large package you handed to him at your joint graduation party.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 198 That stupid tee has been a permanent member of his wardrobe ever since you gave it to him on his graduation. 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 199 He's got an air of purposefully obnoxious pride*
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 200 *He flexes the logo of his "Hardvard" muscle tee, pushing it out to the two of you with his thumbs hooking the arm holes.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 201 "I've physical proof of my superior intellect."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 202 Vince:  "Hey! if you're gonna call someone dumb make it that guy."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 203 *You and Vince simultaneously throw your hands up in defense*
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 204 Swift: "Thought hearing input from the less intelligent might give me a change in perspective~."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 205 I seem to have forgotten the basics."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 206 Swift: "In my effort to enrich my code with the complexities and nuances of my mother language-
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 207 Swift: "Precisely that, it’s simplicity of the problem that's- 'stumping me'."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 208 If it's so easy, what's got you stumped?"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 209 Vince: "'Elementary?'
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 210 "And the problem is just so elementary. I swear it's driving me MAD!"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 211 Swift: "Ugh, You don't even know the half of it."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 212 You said you got project troubles?"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 213 The bird just melts under his touch and you swear it's looking right at you while it happens, the snake.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 214 "Hi Darwin~
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 215 *He hands her the mug and then nods to the bright orange bird daintily perched on her finger and gives it a pet with his pinky as he coos*
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 216 Vince: "Hey Swift~
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 217 Luckily for that little feather ball, Vincent waltzes in with another mug of coffee to break the tension.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 218 You glare at it, and it glares right back. You think it even snorts at you.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 219 You also notice that she's brought that dang bird again as well. 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 220 Almost.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 221 The smile she gives you is so disarming it's almost easy to forget how bad things go when she needs something from the two of you…
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 222 Swift: "I hope you're dressed, I have something for you and Vinny to see."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 223 The sharp clacking of heels and the smell of perfume the price of a small child's kidney—all act as personal fanfare for the woman who taps at the wall of your already open door.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 224 Right as you're pulling down a decent sweatshirt, you hear the apartment buzzer and Vince's muffled voice greeting Swift and letting her into the building.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 225 You almost trip over yourself getting to the doorway and Vince gives you a swat on the back of the head as you squeeze past him.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 226 Man, he's right.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 227 He laughs as you slap a hand to your face.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 228 "You're, uh... Drooling."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 229 "Also, You might want to wash up."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 230 Vince: "Here, this should help."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 231 He disappears from the doorway for a moment and then returns with a homemade-looking mug full of what smells like coffee.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 232 Vince: "Uh, oh. Go hit your face with some water and then ask me that again."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 233 He looks at you incredulously.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 234 "Who?"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 235 User: "You said... Swift is coming?"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 236 You stare at him in confusion, you're still half asleep if you're being honest

PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 238 "I only had to try like 5 times within the hour."
