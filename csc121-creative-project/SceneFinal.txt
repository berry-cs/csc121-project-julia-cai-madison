PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 5 Hm.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 3 6 Swift waves daintily at the two of you $ as she sees herself to the door.

PASSIVE images/BED.png 3 154 She must sense your despair because she $ flashes you a devious smile and scrolls $ to the top of one of her files.

PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 156 It couldn't be any smaller than a deeply $ complex program made by a team professionals.

PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 164 She clicks her tongue and Darwin uses a manicured $ claw to swipe to the next slide showing a $ picture of a class diagram.  
PASSIVE images/BED.png 4 165 "My project is simple enough."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 166 An, impressive trick, you will admit. But that's all the $ praise that flying rat is getting from you.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 167 Then, she blows a short whistle to Darwin $ and the bird straightens to attention, $ swooping up to grab her phone and suspend it in $ midair for our viewing pleasure.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 168 She pulls out her similarly hot pink phone and pulls $ up a picture of what looks to be a slideshow $ of some kind. 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 4 169 "Now then..."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 4 170 "Upgrades~"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 9 171 "Could've sworn it was rose gold like the week $ before..."

PASSIVE images/BED.png 9 174 "That looks new..."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 175 It's practically factory new and you have a feeling $ that's not too far off the mark.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 176 She somehow pulls out a slim, violently pink laptop $ from the deepest reaches of her long leather coat $ and sits it on your small kitchen table.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 4 177 "Now about my project."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 9 178 "Wha-"

PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 187 "I still don't understand why $ you don't just wear your real one."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 10 188 "'Hardvard,' God, it kills me every time."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 11 189 He looks down at it and giggles to himself and fakes $ flicking away a tear.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 10 190 "Just happen to really like this one."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 9 191 "Oh come off it you know I have clothes."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 5 192 "I mean this with love, but do you need a $ trip to Banana Republic?"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 5 193 "Vince dear, I swear to god I saw you wear that $  exact tee-shirt Monday, Wednesday and Yesterday."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 194 You had no idea just how serious he was.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 195 He pulled that tee right over his robe and vowed $ rather loudly to both of your attending families $ that he would wear this shirt "Every single day."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 196 His family got a chuckle out of it but Vince, $ you might as well have given him a new puppy.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 197 You still remember the look on his face $ when he opened that misleadingly large $ package you handed to him at your $ joint graduation party.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 198 That stupid tee has been a permanent $ member of his wardrobe ever since you gave it $ to him on his graduation. 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 11 199 He's got an air of purposefully $ obnoxious pride.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 11 200 He flexes the logo of his "Hardvard" $ muscle tee, pushing it out to the two of you with $ his thumbs hooking the arm holes.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 11 201 "I've physical proof of my superior $ intellect."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 9 202 "Hey! if you're gonna call someone $ dumb make it that guy."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 8 203 You and Vince simultaneously throw $ your hands up in defense.

PASSIVE images/BED.png 5 205 "I seem to have forgotten the basics."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 4 206 "In my effort to enrich my code with the $ complexities and nuances of my mother language-"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 5 207 "Precisely that, it’s simplicity of the $ problem that's- 'stumping me'."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 7 208 "If it's so easy, what's got you stumped?"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 7 209 "'Elementary?'"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 5 210 "And the problem is just so elementary. $ I swear it's driving me MAD!"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 5 211 "Ugh, You don't even know the half of it."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 7 212 "You said you got project troubles?"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 3 213 The bird just melts under his touch and you swear $ it's looking right at you while it happens, the snake.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 10 214 "Hi Darwin~"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 215 He hands her the mug and then nods to the bright $ orange bird daintily perched on her $ finger and gives it a pet with his pinky as he coos.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 10 216 "Hey Swift~"
PASSIVE images/BED.png 6 217 Luckily for that little feather ball, $ Vincent waltzes in with another mug $ of coffee to break the tension.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 3 218 You glare at it, and it glares right back. $ You think it even snorts at you.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 3 219 You also notice that she's brought $ that dang bird again as well. 
PASSIVE images/BED.png 3 220 Almost.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 3 221 The smile she gives you is so disarming $ it's almost easy to forget how bad things go $ when she needs something from the two of you…
PASSIVE images/BED.png 4 222 "I hope you're dressed, $ I have something for you and Vinny to see."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 223 The sharp clacking of heels and the $ smell of perfume the price of a small child's kidney— $ all act as personal fanfare for the woman who $ taps at the wall of your already open door.
PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 224 Right as you're pulling down a decent sweatshirt, $ you hear the apartment buzzer and Vince's muffled voice $ greeting Swift and letting her into the building.

PASSIVE images/BED.png 2 226 Man, he's right.

PASSIVE images/BED.png 11 228 "You're, uh... Drooling."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 7 229 "Also, You might want to wash up."
PASSIVE images/BED.png 7 230 "Here, this should help."
